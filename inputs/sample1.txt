How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
Who arth thou naive who so taketh' the field this day?
Have you no heart, nor fist to clench in rage and to emote this day!
Maketh ready your mind for your god.
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusing, confounding the British henchmen
Everyone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!
Lafayette!
